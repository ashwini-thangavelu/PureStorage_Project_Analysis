 A. **NETWORKED:-**
                  One Network provides a secure, flexible and highly reliable cloud business network platform in which all parties in a supply chain can see the status of their orders. The Dallas-based service provider facilitates orders involving one-third of all grocery items in the United States. It handles the bulk of car parts for domestic automakers, all ammunition for the Marine Corps, and many other items in a broad range of industries. On average One Network handles around 1.3 million transactions a day. By installing Pure Storage, One Network has benefited from increased network availability, a sharp reduction in system and database maintenance, greater productivity in its software-development process, and the ability to offer customers more tools for business analytics.
  B.  **DIRECT – ATTACHED:-**
                           Direct-attached storage, or DAS, is a digital storage system that connects directly to a personal computer, workstation, or server, but is not attached to a network. Because DAS is connected to only one computer or server (though it can be internal or external), it is not accessible to other computers unless they connect to it through the host computer.
            Forms of direct-attached storage include hard drives and solid-state drives (SSD), optical devices such as CDs and DVDs, and tape storage.
  C.  **PUBLIC CLOUD:-**
                      A public cloud is a type of cloud in which a set of services are delivered to businesses or organizations by third-party providers via the internet. Service providers offer resources such as applications, compute, and storage through free or pay-per-usage models.
                      
  Applications that process this data have very different requirements, which created silos.  Each application required its own tailored storage architecture resulting in different user experiences.  At pure we focused on alleviating the challenges of networked storage (San and nas) with flash array™ and flash blade™ by building a product from the ground up on flash, not disk.  We recently debuted cloud block store, a new series of cloud data services to enhance the public cloud.  But we didn’t focus much on das which runs many of the analytics and highly concurrent applications of today.
